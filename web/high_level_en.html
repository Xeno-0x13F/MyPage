    Doing score research
    </h3>
    <p>
    When the difficulty level reaches MASTER, the score is not easy to understand on the first sight.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is where score research is necessary. It is very important to know why you are not doing well.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are many ways to do this, such as watching videos of AP's hands to check fingering and hitting,
    </p>
    <p>
    or recording and reviewing your own playing, but I think you can improve a lot just by studying scores.
    </p>
    <p>
    Think about why you are not doing well and how to improve, and practice with this in mind every time.
    </p>
    <p>
    One way to help with the difficult parts is to refer to the fingering of someone who is good at it.
    </p>
    <p>
    Try different fingerings to find the one that suits you best!
    </p>
    <p>
    (The sense of accomplishment when you get an AP with your own fingerings,
    </p>
    <p>
    which you made by trial and error, is amazing.)
    </p>
    <p class="space">
    Personally, I would like to introduce two scores that made me realize the ‚Äúgreatness of score research‚Äù.
    </p>
    <h5>
    1, Milkcrown on Sonechica

    Recognition difficulty before the chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
    I couldn't do it at all before the research,
    </p>
    <p>
    but after I studied to recognize
    </p>
    <p>
    the music by dividing the score, I was
    </p>
    <p>
    able to go through it quite consistently.
    </p>

    The outro is difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
    I knew that I would never be able to play this type of score
    </p>
    <p>
    unless I had a solid fingering system in place
    </p>
    <p>
    before I played it, so research was a must.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is easy if you set the fingerings well.

    Change settings to suit your mood or song
    </h3>
    <p>
    I think sometimes the judgments seem to be a little off for some songs.
    </p>
    <p>
    When aiming for AP, it is out of the question to be misjudged.
    </p>
    <p>
    Tinker with the ‚ÄúTiming Adjustment‚Äù setting as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
    Also, as the difficulty level gets higher and the amount of material increases,
    </p>
    <p>
    it may be a good idea to increase the ‚Äúspeed of the notes‚Äù to reduce visibility.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can change with or without SE depending on your mood, but there may be some songs
    </p>
    <p>
    that are easier to play with SE and others that are easier to play without, so try different songs.
    </p>
    <p>
    (Personally, I find it easier to play songs with a lot of trills and swing rhythms with SE.)
