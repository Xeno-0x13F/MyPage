    Mental health management
    </h3>
    <p>
    The first step is mental health management. The most important thing in playing a game is to enjoy it,
    </p>
    <p>
    so this is not the time to lose confidence because you can't do it well.
    </p>
    <p>
    Play the game with confidence and enjoyment on a regular basis.(?)
    </p>
    <p class="space">
    That said, everyone has times when they falter.
    </p>
    <p>
    So here are four of my own "ways to stay motivated"!
    </p>
    <h5>
    1, Set small goals.
    </h5>
    <p>
    "FC all EXPERT songs by the end of the year!",
    </p>
    <p>
    "AP 3 more MASTER songs by the end of this month!" etc...
    </p>
    <p>
    It is all very well to set goals, but with such large goals,
    </p>
    <p>
    there is the potential for overwhelming mental damage
    </p>
    <p>
    if you give up or fail to achieve them along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'm sure you've all had that experience, right? (Is it just me?)
    </p>
    <p>
    In such cases, try to set small goals. It doesn't matter how small it is.
    </p>
    <p>
    By setting and achieving many goals that can be accomplished quickly,
    </p>
    <p>
    you can keep yourself motivated each day and steadily build your skills.
    </p>
    <h5>
    2, Don't try too hard.
    </h5>
    <p>
    It's already as good as the word. Continuously playing the same score for long periods of time
    </p>
    <p>
    in pursuit of FC or AP can cause habits to develop.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you get into the habit, you will make many of the same mistakes in the same places,
    </p>
    <div class="flex">
    <img class="fadeInTrigger img1" src="1.jpg" alt="zetsubou">

    </p>
    <p class="fadeInTrigger zetsubou2">
    overwhelming despair
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>
    This is what happens. (Experienced person knows the things)
    </p>
    <p>
    Sometimes it is important to give up gracefully. If you feel swamped or not doing very well,
    </p>
    <p>
    stop immediately. (Strategic retreat)
    </p>
    <h5>
    3, Do something else for a change.
    </h5>
    <p>
    If you are not feeling well, turn your attention to anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
    By daring not to touch a rhythm game for a certain period of time,
    </p>
    <p>
    you may be able to break the habit and achieve unexpected results the next time you play!
    </p>
    <h5>
    4, Your fav in your eyes.
    </h5>
    <div class="flex">
    <div>
    <p class="space">
    This is also a kind of mood swings,
    </p>
    <p>
    but again, favs stabilizes
    </p>
    <p>
    our spirit just by being in view.
    </p>
    <p>
    Let's worship a lot! (?)

    Watch videos of people who play well
    </h3>
    <p>
    Watching videos of people who play well is also a shortcut to improving.
    </p>
    <p>
    Here are two types of videos to help you improve.
    </p>
    <p>
    Please look for them on social networking sites and video sites!
    </p>
    <h5>
    Explanatory Videos
    </h5>
    <p>
    It mainly includes explanations of game specifications and their application,
    </p>
    <p>
    as well as fingering explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
    Especially for "long notes", there is a big difference between understanding the specifications
    </p>
    <p>
    and not understanding them, so we recommend that you read the explanation.
    </p>
    <h5>
    Play Videos
    </h5>
    <p>
    Mostly "AP hands", but I also enjoy seeing the ‚Äúfirst reaction and response‚Äù of people who play well.
    </p>
    <p>
    I also recommend "Play Videos" with explanations,
    </p>
    <p>
    as it is easy to understand the tips and things to be aware of.
    </p>
    <h3 class="fadeInTrigger sub">
    Exposure to many scores
    </h3>
    <div class="flex">
    <div>
    <p>
    If you play a variety of scores,
    </p>
    <p>
    you will learn the patterns of the score,
    </p>
    <p>
    so you will be able to get similar placements
    </p>
    <p>
    on the first try.
    </p>
    <p>
    By playing not only prsk but also
    </p>
    <p>
    other rhythm games, you can gain
    </p>
    <p>
     ‚Äúground in all aspects of rhythm games‚Äù.
